=head1 NAME

Proc::Launcher::Supervisor - restart watched processes that have exited


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a tiny module that's designed for use with panctl and
L<Proc::Launcher>, where it is forked off and run as a separate process.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 8

=item monitor_delay

Number of seconds to sleep before attempting to restart any daemons
that aren't running.  Defaults to 15.

=item manager

A L<Proc::Launcher::Manager> object, with daemons already registered.
The supervisor will call the manager's start method at regular
intervals.  This will start any daemons that are not found running.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 8

=item $obj->monitor()

This tiny class contains only this one method.

It will repeatedly sleep for a configured period of time (default 15
seconds), and then call start_all() on the manager object.  This will
result in restarting any processes that have stopped.
